# Noam

Noam is a JavaScript library for working with automata and formal grammars for regular and context-free languages.

Noam's name comes from [Noam Chomsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) and his [hierarchy of formal languages and grammars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy).

## Status

Pre-alpha. 
Horrible performance, only functions for working with FSMs implemented.
Stay tuned.
